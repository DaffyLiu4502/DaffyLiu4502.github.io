			<p>During the 2018-2019 school year, only 19.8 percent of students were enrolled in free and
				reduced lunch at Gentry Middle School, according to Columbia Public Schools. In the same year
				and 9 miles away, more than 60 percent of students were enrolled in free and reduced lunch at
				Lange Middle School.
			</p>
			<p>The Columbia Board of Education’s goal of increasing diversity throughout public schools has
				been put on the back burner, after another shift of school attendance zones failed to overcome
				neighborhood segregation within the city. </p>
			<p>Segregation is not affected by Columbia Public School District alone.
				Scott Leopold, Cooperative Strategies company partner says lack of resources is to blame. </p>
			<p>“The underlying issue is the lack of distributed affordable housing,” Scott Leopold,
				Cooperative Strategies company partner. “When you have affordable housing concentrated in
				specific areas, you're going to have poverty concentrated in those specific areas.” </p>
			<p>If the board and the Columbia Housing Authority worked together to buy property for new
				developments, segregation would be slightly improved with the opening of every new school,
				Phil Steinhaus, CEO of Columbia Housing Authority said.
