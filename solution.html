			</div>
			<p>Teachers across Columbia Public Schools are taking bigger steps to better support students most affected by education inequity.</p>
			<p>Lynn Hagen, an English teacher at Battle High School, started Project LIT group at Battle High,
				a club that encourages literacy and academic success in students. Hagen opened the club last year
				at Battle High, joining 20 other states that have Project LIT chapters in their schools.
				The club meets once a month to discuss books and relevant ideas. Along the way, students feel
				more motivated and better prepared for academic success, according to Hagen. </p>

					if you let kids choose the books that they're going to read, and you pick things that are relevant to their lives, that they
					do find that reading is really valuable,” Hagen said. </figcaption>

					“That’s why we do it first.” </figcaption>

					Clubs like Project LIT serves as a space for students to improve their reading and comprehension skills. “These are kids who are labeled
					struggling readers and kids who are labeled resistance students and behavior problems,” Hagen said. “No, they're not. They're just bored.
					They don't like some of the things that they're doing. They're smart kids.” </figcaption>

					Hagen said. “And I have all the confidence in the world that these kids are going to do well in college.” </figcaption>
